This is a simple three-card reading (past-present-future). Please note that because this is a prototype, I have not included all tarot cards.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Develop Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install` from the root directory

`npm run start` runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
